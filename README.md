# minesweeper
This is Marksweeper, my version of Minesweeper built as a terminal game. I built this for a portfolio project as part of the Codecademy Computer Science professional certification course. The project gave me great hands on experience with object oriented programming, handling user input, checking edge cases, and I even got to use some recursion! Very fun.
